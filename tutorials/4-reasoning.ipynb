    "# Reasoning in LTN\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial defines and illustrates reasoning in LTN. It expects basic familiarity with other parts of LTN. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Logical Consequence in LTN\n",
    "\n",
    "The essence of reasoning is to determine if a closed formula $\\phi$ is the logical consequence of a knowledgebase $(\\mathcal{K},\\mathcal{G}_\\theta,\\Theta)$, where $\\mathcal{K}$ denotes the set of rules in the knowledgebase and $\\mathcal{G}_\\theta$ denotes a grounding that depends on some parameters $\\theta \\in \\Theta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notion of logical consequence is adapted to Real Logic as follows:\n",
    "- In classical logic (boolean truth values), a formula $\\phi$ is the logical consequence of a knowledgebase $\\mathcal{K}$ if, for every interpretation (or model) that verifies the formulas in $\\mathcal{K}$, $\\phi$ is verified;\n",
    "- In Real Logic (fuzzy truth values), a formula $\\phi$ is the logical consequence of $(\\mathcal{K},\\mathcal{G}_\\theta,\\Theta)$ if, for every grounding $\\mathcal{G}_\\theta$ such that $\\mathrm{SatAgg}_{\\phi'\\in\\mathcal{K}}\\mathcal{G}_{\\theta}(\\phi') \\geq q $, we have $\\mathcal{G}_\\theta(\\phi)\\geq q$, where $q$ is a fixed satisfaction threshold. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Logical consequence in Real Logic, by direct application of the definition, requires querying the truth value of $\\phi$ for a potentially infinite set of groundings. \n",
    "We therefore, in practice, consider the following directions:\n",
    "1. **Reasoning by brave inference**: one seeks to verify if for all the grounded theories that *maximally satisfy* $\\mathcal{K}$, \n",
    "    the grounding of $\\phi$ gives a truth value greater than a threshold $q$.\n",
    "    This often requires to check an infinite number of groundings.\n",
    "    Instead, one can approximate the search for these grounded theories by running the optimization w.r.t. the knowledgebase satisfiability multiple times and checking these groundings only.\n",
    "2. **Reasoning by refutation**:   one seeks to find out a counterexample of a grounding that does satisfy the knowledgebase $\\mathcal{K}$ but not the formula $\\phi$ (given the threshold $q$). A directed search for such examples is performed using a different learning objective.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we illustrate the second option, **reasoning by refutation**. "
